## UI Developer Homework Assignment

### Problem

A retailer offers a rewards program to its customers, awarding points based on each recorded purchase.

A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every dollar spent between $50 and $100 in each transaction.

### Expected Output

Given a record of every transaction during a three month period, calculate the reward points earned for each customer per month and total.

### Example

$120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points

### Additional Notes

- Use React JS (do not use TypeScript)
- Simulate an asynchronous API call to fetch data
- Make up a data set to best demonstrate your solution

### Assumptions To Be Considered

- Points will only be rewarded to whole dollar amounts
- Amount of months could potentially change over time
- No transactions for a member is a possible case
